# 2048-game

## Introduction

I have developed the famous 2048 game using C++ programming language. The game starts with random 2 & 4 at 2 places of a 4x4 matrix. 
Then the player can use left, right, up and down arrow keys to move and match the tiles. If there is no empty cell and no adjacent same value tiles, the player loses.

## Functions used

srand(time(0)) is used as a seed for the random number generation, this allows multiple attempts for the player
system("cls") is used to clear the screen
